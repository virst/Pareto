Pareto

<b>Pareto efficiency</b> or Pareto optimality is a situation that that cannot be modified so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off. The concept is named after Vilfredo Pareto (1848â€“1923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of economic efficiency and income distribution. The following three concepts are closely related:

Given an initial situation, a Pareto improvement is a new situation which is weakly preferred by all agents, and strictly preferred by at least one agent. In a sense, it is a unanimously-agreed improvement: if we move to the new situation, some agents will gain, and no agents will lose.
A situation is called Pareto dominated if it has a Pareto improvement.
A situation is called Pareto optimal or Pareto efficient if it is not Pareto dominated.
The Pareto frontier is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown graphically. It also is variously known as the Pareto front or Pareto set.
